# CPSC471_Project

To get this up and running for testing you will need to activate the python vitual environment that the project uses. 

Django can be started from the src directory using <code>python manage.py runserver</code>

Changes to the code will be updated live, changes to the database can be made from the src directory with:
  
  <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code>
  <code>python manage.py migrate</code>

Look in the front end folder for instructions on running React

Most of the dependencies should be dealt with by the virtual env, but you'll need Python and likely Node.js
